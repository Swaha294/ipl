The goal of `ipl` is to provide data and functions related to the Indian Premier Leage (IPL) matches and standard cricket statistics. This package allows users to avail of IPL data and conduct analysis of cricketers and IPL teams using functions of this package.

This is package is important because there isn't a consolidated database where one can find all the data to analyse past IPL matches and players. These functions will also aid in conducting data analysis for those who are interested in analysing IPL trends.


## Description

The `ipl` R package consists of datasets on all IPL matches played in the years 2008-2020, and provides functions to calculate typical crickets statistics. 

Our package includes datasets on IPL matches played and cricketers in the years 2008-2020, acquired primarily from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), which have been cleaned so users can use it directly for data analysis. Moreover, it comprises functions for analysis of individual cricketers and games, as well as summary statistics for the same.


## Installation

``` {r}
remotes::install_github("Swaha294/ipl")
