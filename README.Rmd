Our package includes datasets on IPL matches played and cricketers in the years 2008-2020, acquired primarily from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), which have been cleaned so users can use it directly for data analysis. Moreover, it comprises functions for analysis of individual cricketers and games, as well as summary statistics for the same.
