The goal of `ipl` is to provide data and functions related to the Indian
Premier Leage (IPL) matches and standard cricket statistics. This
package allows users to avail of IPL data and conduct analysis of
cricketers and IPL teams using functions of this package.

This is package is important because there isnâ€™t a consolidated database
where one can find all the data to analyse past IPL matches and players.
These functions will also aid in conducting data analysis for those who
are interested in analysing IPL trends.

## Description

The `ipl` R package consists of datasets on all IPL matches played in
the years 2008-2020, and provides functions to calculate typical
crickets statistics.

Our package includes datasets on IPL matches played and cricketers in
the years 2008-2020, acquired primarily from
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), which have been cleaned so users can
use it directly for data analysis. Moreover, it comprises functions for
analysis of individual cricketers and games, as well as summary
statistics for the same.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `ipl` like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("Swaha294/ipl")
#> Skipping install of 'ipl' from a github remote, the SHA1 (4acf56a3) has not changed since last install.
#>   Use `force = TRUE` to force installation
```

## Datasets Included
